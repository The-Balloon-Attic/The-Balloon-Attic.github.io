## Edge Case Handling
- **Slow connections**: Show skeleton states for images, ensure text content loads first
- **Touch devices**: Ensure balloon animations don't interfere with scrolling, optimize hover states for touch
- **Small screens**: Stack sections vertically, reduce balloon complexity on mobile if needed
- **No JavaScript**: Core content remains accessible, animations degrade gracefully
- **Long page sessions**: Ensure animations don't cause memory leaks or performance degradation

## Design Direction
The design should feel soft, whimsical, and elegantâ€”like walking into a boutique party planning studio. It should balance playfulness (floating balloons, pastel colors) with professionalism (clean typography, smooth transitions). A minimal interface that lets the balloon work shine while providing clear navigation and contact pathways.

## Font Selection
Elegant, flowing script for the business name to match the reference image's sophisticated handwritten style, paired with a clean modern sans-serif for body text to ensure readability while maintaining elegance.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - Hero Title (Business Name): Tangerine or Dancing Script/48-72px/normal weight/loose letter spacing - Flowing script mimicking reference
  - Section Headings: Inter or Outfit/32-40px/semi-bold/tight letter spacing - Clean, modern
  - Body Text: Inter/16-18px/regular/normal letter spacing/1.6 line height - Readable, professional
  - Subtitle (West Cork): Inter/18-24px/light/wide letter spacing - Elegant, airy
  - CTA Buttons: Inter/16px/medium/slight letter spacing - Clear, actionable

## Animations
Animations should feel like gentle breezes moving balloonsâ€”light, natural, and continuous without being distracting. The balance leans toward subtle functionality with strategic moments of delight during scroll reveals.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Floating balloons communicate the lightness and joy of the business; scroll reveals create a sense of discovery and elegance; hover effects on gallery items invite exploration
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: 
  1. Hero balloons (continuous subtle float) - Most prominent, sets brand tone
  2. Scroll-triggered section reveals (fade + translate up) - Medium priority, guides navigation
  3. Gallery image hover effects (scale + shadow) - Subtle, rewards exploration
